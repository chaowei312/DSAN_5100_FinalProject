# GDP Growth Rate Analysis and Prediction

A data science project analyzing and predicting GDP growth rates using feature selection and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project explores GDP growth rate data through multiple feature selection methods and builds predictive models using Random Forest regression.

## Methods

### Feature Selection
- **Correlation-based Selection**: Identifying features with strong linear relationships to GDP growth
- **Mutual Information Selection**: Capturing non-linear dependencies between features and target
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Tree-based feature ranking

### Prediction
- Random Forest regression model for GDP growth rate prediction
- Train/test comparison and evaluation
